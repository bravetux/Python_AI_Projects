    Play a game of Hangman with the given word.

    Parameters
    ----------
    word : str

    Returns

    None

    Notes
    -----
    The game will continue until the player either guesses the word
    or runs out of attempts (i.e., the Hangman is fully drawn).

    The player is prompted to enter a single letter at a time, and
    the game will display the current state of the Hangman and the
    word (with underscores in place of unguessed letters).

    If the player guesses a letter that is not in the word, the
    game will increment the wrong_guesses counter. If the player guesses
    a letter that is in the word, the game will display the correctly
    guessed letter in its correct position.

    If the player has guessed all the letters in the word, the game
    will end and display a winning message. If the player has run out
    of attempts, the game will end and display a losing message.
